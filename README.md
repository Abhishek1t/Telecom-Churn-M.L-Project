# Telecom-Churn-M.L-Project
Introduction:
Churn Prediction is most popularly used in business. It consists of detecting customers who are likely to cancel a subscription to a service.
It is very easy for customers to switch from one service provider to another service provider for better price rates or service quality.
 
Business Problem Overview:
1.In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. 
2.In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate.
3.Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. 
4.To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
1.To predict Customer Churn.
2.Using various ML algorithms to build prediction models and to evaluate the accuracy, correlation between the variables and performance of these models.
3.We predict behavior to retain customers and try to analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.
